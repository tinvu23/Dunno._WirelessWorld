Whether you’re looking for performance, camera smarts, or value, our definitive list of the ten best phones has it all.</p><p>The top phone on this rundown won’t be the ideal phone for everybody so make sure to check out all ten. The best phone for you is out there, depending on what you value most – camera, battery life, design, specs, price, and more to boot come into play.</p>', '<p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1. iPhone 13 Pro – Best iPhone</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3677861/iphone_13_pro_review_1.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro - Best iPhone\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>120Hz display</li><li>Superb cameras</li><li>Top-tier performance</li><li>Improved battery life</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Cinematography Mode and HDR algorithm need work</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p>Unlike 2020 – where the standard iPhone 12 won out against its Pro-branded sibling – 2021’s iPhone 13 Pro is undoubtedly the one to beat.</p><p>At first glance, the 13 Pro uses a familiar 6.1in Super Retina XDR display but Apple has finally decided to bring ProMotion to the iPhone; with the panel now topping out at a super-smooth 120Hz. The notch is also 20% smaller too.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the cameras, you can expect bigger sensors and faster apertures that mean improved low light performance, far more comparable quality when switching to the phone’s ultrawide (which also now offers macro shooting capabilities) and a 3x telephoto snapper, letting you shoot further than before.</p><p>What’s more, the iPhone still leads when it comes to video capture, gaining some smart new features like Cinematography Mode, granting greater control over how your footage looks in the moment.</p><p>Pair that ProMotion tech with the phone’s powerful A15 Bionic chip and a bigger battery, and you can expect some sizeable longevity gains; rendering this a two-day iPhone on a single charge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra – Best Android phone</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3677861/galaxy_s22_ultra_hands_on_19.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra - Best Android phone\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Excellent camera</li><li>Phenomenal display</li><li>Stylus support</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Bulky</li><li>Expensive</li><li>Slower charging</li></ul><p>While the S21 Ultra dabbled with Note-like features, the Galaxy S22 Ultra is unquestionably a full-blown successor to 2020’s Note 20 Ultra in everything but name.</p><p>The design is distinctly different from the other entries in the Galaxy S22 range (which is to say very ‘Note-like’) and features an integrated S Pen stylus that expands functionality beyond most rivals, especially in terms of productivity.</p><p>Despite familiar-looking camera hardware, the upgrades made by Samsung render it one of the best systems in any phone right now; with a 108Mp main shooter backed up by an ultrawide and two telephoto lenses at different zoom levels – with the zoom performance particularly improved on previous models.</p><p>The expansive 6.8in LTPO AMOLED display delivers both high WQHD+ resolution and an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, while long-term software support that surpasses even Google’s Pixels rounds out an impressive list of pros.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. iPhone 13 – Superb all-rounder</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3677861/iphone_13_review_2.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 13 - Superb all-rounder\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Brilliant performance</li><li>Capable cameras</li><li>Long battery life</li><li>Great value</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Still a 60Hz display</li><li>No telephoto camera</li><li>Slow charging</li></ul><p>While it loses out on the 13 Pro’s high refresh rate display, the iPhone 13 still boasts cutting-edge features like Apple’s newest 5nm A15 Bionic chip and the latest camera features, like Cinematic Mode.</p><p>The rear camera system now sits at a diagonal, primarily to accommodate the impressive sensor-shift OIS (optical image stabilisation) that was exclusive to 2020’s iPhone 12 Pro Max (although there’s still no telephoto sensor), while on the front – despite the same 60Hz refresh rate as the previous model – you still get a stunning 6.1in OLED display, complete with a smaller notch.</p><p>iOS 15 is an excellent improvement on Apple’s already well-respected mobile operating system out of the box; adding wellbeing features like notification summary, that ensure you’re not constantly distracted by your device.</p><p>Like the Pro, some of the best battery life on an iPhone comes as part of the iPhone 13 experience but fast charging speeds are still well behind the curve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4. Google Pixel 6a</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Google-Pixel-6A_review_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Google Pixel 6a\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Google-Pixel-6A_review_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Google-Pixel-6A_review_1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Google-Pixel-6A_review_1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Google-Pixel-6A_review_1.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Google-Pixel-6A_review_1.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Google-Pixel-6A_review_1.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Google-Pixel-6A_review_1.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"2000\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Great performance</li><li>Solid battery life</li><li>Very good camera</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>60Hz display</li><li>Slow charging</li><li>Back plastic scratches easily</li></ul><p>Although the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have bigger, better screens and improved cameras, the $449/£399/€459 is better value and the Pixel phone most people should buy.</p><p>For the asking price you get the Google Tensor chip, the same as the 6 and 6 Pro, resulting in flagship level performance. Older A-series Pixels were sluggish – not this one.</p><p>You only get a 60Hz refresh rate screen, slow 18W charging, and a plastic back that we found scratches quite easily. There’s also only a 12.2Mp main camera, the same as on the Pixel 5, rather than the Pixel 6’s 50Mp shooter.</p><p>But aside from that this is close to the full Pixel experience at a superb price, with three years of Android OS updates and five years of security updates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5. Google Pixel 6 Pro – Best user experience</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3677861/google_pixel_6_pro_review_29.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 6 Pro - Best user experience\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>120Hz display</li><li>Superb cameras</li><li>Slick OS</li><li>Greatly improved battery life</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Biggest, thickest, heaviest Pixel yet</li><li>Awkward fast charging</li></ul><p>Google shook things up for 2021, with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro debuting the company’s own Tensor silicon and a refreshed Android 12 experience out the box, along with a completely new design and some significantly enhanced cameras.</p><p>Despite dropping the ‘Pixel XL’ naming convention, the 6 Pro is an undeniably sizeable phone, with a stunning QHD+ curved-edge OLED display that – for the first time in the series – makes the move to a higher, smoother 120Hz refresh rate (just like the iPhone 13 Pro range).</p><p>The camera system also relies on a new 50Mp main sensor, which delivers astounding dynamic range and showcases smart new features, like Magic Eraser and rock-solid Face Unblur. It’s also backed up by both a 12Mp ultrawide and a periscopic 48Mp telephoto camera, with a 4x optical zoom; a far cry from the Pixel range’s old single-sensor approach to photography.</p><p>Tensor doesn’t benchmark well against the competition but in real-world use offers more than enough grunt to handle the most demanding mobile apps and games, while also boasting a specialised skill set for machine learning and AI tasks that rival silicon lags behind in.</p><p>A huge 5003mAh battery also ensures some of the best battery life on a Pixel ever, even if fast charging is a bit of a mess.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>6. Oppo Find X5 Pro – Superb cameras</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3677861/oppo_find_x5_pro-05.jpg\" alt=\"Oppo Find X5 Pro - Superb cameras\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Best-in-class display</li><li>Versatile cameras</li><li>Unique design</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>No periscopic zoom</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><p>The Oppo Find X5 Pro is a phenomenal phone by any measure. The 6.7in 10-bit 120Hz QHD+ panel is one of the best displays in any phone right now and Oppo backs it up with 80W wired and 50W wireless charging, a 5000mAh battery, and a top-tier camera that boasts 50Mp sensors on both the main and ultrawide lenses.</p><p>You’ll have to live without a periscopic zoom lens – the telephoto here is a measly 2x zoom – but results across all three rear lenses are exceptional. The design is unique too, thanks to a seamlessly sloped camera module built right into the ceramic of the phone’s body.</p><p>In terms of pure performance, the Find X5 Pro is also hard to beat, with all of the above, plus a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, 256GB storage and 12GB RAM. You just have to be willing to pay the price, as it doesn’t come cheap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>7. OnePlus 10 Pro – Outstanding battery life</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3677861/oneplus_10_pro_review_10.jpg\" alt=\"OnePlus 10 Pro - Outstanding battery life\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Super-fast 80W wired charging</li><li>Great longevity</li><li>Top specs</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Inconsistent cameras</li><li>No IP rating</li></ul><p>The latest flagship phone from OnePlus is a good alternative to the likes of the S22 or Pixel 6 series, especially if you live in the US and have few other high-end Android options.</p><p>With a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and speedy 80W wired charging the 10 Pro has core specs to match anything its rivals offer, and we’re broadly fans of the slick design too – though not everyone is.</p><p>Despite support from Hasselblad, the camera system is still the phone’s primary weakness here and the main thing that sets it apart from the pricier but similarly-specced Oppo Find X5 Pro.</p><p>The rear triple sensor setup is impressive, don’t get us wrong, but inconsistencies – especially in exposure – only serve to remind us that it’s not up there with the best of the best, and that makes it a touch harder to recommend; even if the OxygenOS user experience is superb and battery life is among the best of any flagship currently out there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>8. Vivo X80 Pro</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vivo_x80_pro_review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Vivo X80 Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vivo_x80_pro_review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vivo_x80_pro_review.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vivo_x80_pro_review.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vivo_x80_pro_review.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vivo_x80_pro_review.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vivo_x80_pro_review.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vivo_x80_pro_review.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"2000\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Truly outstanding camera</li><li>Fast wired and wireless charging</li><li>Superb battery life</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Awkward camera design</li><li>No Gorilla Glass</li><li>Frustrating software</li></ul><p>Vivo has knocked it out of the park with the X80 Pro, a phone whose camera is truly excellent, rivalling the best Apple, Samsung, and Google have to offer.</p><p>A Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip powers four rear lenses, the main being a wonderfully capable 50Mp sensor. Every lens benefits from Vivo’s V1+ image processing chip, and there’s gimbal stabilisation on the telephoto lens to aid clarity of zoom shots. It’s an incredibly full feature set, and low-light photography is outstanding. Add to that excellent video modes with cinema-wide aspect ratios and a film-like grain and you’ve got a powerhouse camera in your pocket.</p><p>The phone is a big one so you’ll have to be happy with a 6.78in AMOLED. It’s a 120Hz LTPO (with variable refresh rate) and QHD+ resolution.</p><p>Downsides to the phone are the lack of Gorilla Glass for proven scratch and crack protection to the front and back, and the frustrating software. But overall this is another leap forward for Vivo that you should seriously consider if you want a premium camera on the back of your phone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>9. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 – Best foldable</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3677861/galaxy_z_flip_3_studio_shots_review_1.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 - Best foldable\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Elegant folding design</li><li>Water resistance</li><li>More affordable than ever</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>No telephoto camera</li><li>Middling battery life</li><li>Still needs to be tougher</li></ul><p>Samsung took its already-groundbreaking Galaxy Z Flip foldable, improved every aspect – from design to performance – and then made it cheaper too!</p><p>The Z Flip 3 is a beautiful expression of the evolution of foldable smartphone tech and somehow manages to incorporate water resistance into its design as well.</p><p>Battery life and the dual cameras could be better but despite flagship-class performance in a groundbreaking design, the Flip 3’s pricing also proves that foldables can tango in the same space as conventional smartphones, without any major sacrifices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>10. Xiaomi 12 Pro – Great for multimedia</strong></h3><p><i><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3677861/xiaomi_12_pro_review_3.jpg\" alt=\"Xiaomi 12 Pro - Great for multimedia\"></i></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Nice design</li><li>Excellent display</li><li>Strong cameras</li><li>Fast 120W charging</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Disappointing battery life</li><li>No IP rating</li></ul><p>The Xiaomi 12 Pro has an awful lot going for it, but that’s coupled with a pair of major flaws.</p><p>It sports a sleek, understated design, there’s a beautiful display paired with a quad-speaker setup and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip delivers impressive performance. For the most part, the camera system is great too, not quite best-in-class but good.</p><p>Unfortunately, the battery life is a clear failing – which might be fixed with updates, but for the moment frustrates. If you spend your days not far from a charger, this is a superb phone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>', '2022-07-31 14:03:57', NULL),
(5, 'Top Sellers', 'Top Trending Technologies in 2022', '1659276468.png', '<p>The 21st century has been a century of technological change. Several highly commercial and trending technologies during the early 2000s have entirely vanished, and new ones have taken their place. Many completely new technologies have also come up in 2022, especially in the arena of computer science and engineering. These new technologies in 2022 are only likely to grow and perhaps even reach the common person’s hands.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to learn about trending technologies in 2022-23&nbsp;and stay updated, let’s dive in. Here are the new trending technologies in 2022 you should check out and learn to master if you want to get an edge in the market.</p>', '<p><strong>1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong><br>Artificial intelligence and machine learning once represented the cutting edge of computer science. When these technologies were created in the last 20th century, they hardly had any applications and were, in fact, mostly academic. However, these technologies have gained applications over the years and reached ordinary people’s hands through their mobile phones and is currently one of the latest technologies in computer science.</p><p>Machine learning represents a computer science field in which an algorithm can predict future data based on previously generated data. Artificial intelligence represents the next step in machine learning, in which an algorithm develops data-based intelligence and can even carry out essential tasks on its own.</p><p>Both artificial intelligence and machine learning requires advanced knowledge of statistics. Statistics help you determine the results that your algorithm might throw up for a particular dataset, thus evolving it further. The proliferation of machine learning applications has meant that the number of jobs in this field has also grown.</p><p>Machine learning is among the leading technologies of this century. A career in this domain can expose you to advanced computational infrastructure and novel research in the field making this a fine new technology in 2022 you should consider getting into. Having a job in machine learning and artificial intelligence domain(s) places you at the forefront of technological development in the field of computer science.</p><p>In fields such as retail and e-commerce, machine learning is an essential component to enhance user experience. The product recommendations that you see on such sites are generally a result of a machine learning algorithm analysing your previous searches and recommending similar products to you. In the healthcare field, machine learning can help analyse data to provide treatment insight to physicians. Even though AI is helping us in our day to day lives, it is still a new technology in 2022 considering its potential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Data Science</strong><br>Recent technology in computer science is Data Science. For much of the initial part of the 21st century, data science was the next big thing. Data science has been around for much longer than just the past twenty months. For centuries, data analysis has been an essential task for companies, government, institutions, and departments. Analysing data helps understand the efficiency of processes, conduct surveys of the workforce, and gauge people’s general mood.</p><p>However, as of today, much of data analysis has turned digital. Data analysis is among the first jobs that computers are turned to for. In the early 2000s, data analysis was so prevalent that students were being taught introductory courses on the subject in school.</p><p>In the 2022s, data analysis is likely to blow up more than ever. With computational technology growing at a more excellent pace than ever, the data analysis capabilities in people’s hands are likely to increase. Newer, faster data analysis algorithms and methods are likely to come up and be put into practice.</p><p>The benefit of having a career in data science, regardless of the domain your company works in, is that you are an essential part of the firm’s overall business. The data that you produce and the interpretations that you provide are likely to be a necessary part of the business strategy of any company that you serve.</p><p>In retail and e-commerce, data science is widely used to determine campaigns’ success and the general trend of various products’ growth. This, in turn, helps develop strategies for the promotion of particular products or types of products. In health care, data informatics can be essential in recommending low-cost options and packages to patients and allowing doctors to choose the safest yet most effective treatments for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Full Stack Development</strong><br>Full-stack development refers to the development of both client-side and server-side software and is bound to be one of the top trending technologies of 2021.</p><p>The 21st century started with the dot com boom, and the internet, a relatively new phenomenon, was spreading across homes in the world. In those days, websites were no more than simple web pages, and web development wasn’t the complex field that it is now.</p><p>These days, web development involves a front end and a back end. Especially for fields related to services, such as retail and e-commerce, websites include a client-side—the website that you see—and a server-side—the website that the company controls.</p><p>Generally, web developers are given the job of handling either the client-side or the website’s server-side. However, being a full stack developer gives you and your company the flexibility of working on both ends of the web development spectrum. The client-side or front end will generally require knowledge of suites such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The server side requires knowledge of PHP, ASP, and C++.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Robotic Process Automation</strong><br>Robotic Process Automation isn’t just about robots. It is a lot more about the automation of processes than anything else. Before computers, most processes involved some human intervention. Humans ran even manufacturing machines, and large-scale manufacturing employs thousands of people.</p><p>However, since computers have taken over most processes, manufacturing hasn’t been left untouched either. All domains, be it manufacturing or information technology, now involve some automation in their processes. The amount of human intervention in these processes is only reducing, and this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Jobs in robotic process automation typically involve a significant amount of coding knowledge. You would typically need to write code that would enable computerised or non-computerised processes to be done automatically without human intervention.</p><p>These processes could mean anything from automatic email replies to automated data analysis and automatic processing and financial transactions approval. Robotic process automation makes tasks considerably faster for the common consumer by making such approvals automatic based on certain conditions entered by the programmer.</p><p>In sectors such as financial services, robotic process automation can reduce the lean time to approve financial transactions online. It improves the productivity of the company as a whole, as well as that of its clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Edge Computing</strong><br>During the early part of the 21st century, cloud computing was considered the next big thing. In cloud computing, data is uploaded to a centralised repository that may access it regardless of location. Cloud Computing began to be used in commercial devices only close to 2010. By the time it was 2022, cloud computing had become a prevalent technology.</p><p>In just about a decade, cloud computing had turned from being an esoteric term to being a part of a few devices in almost everybody’s house. In 2022, cloud computing is no longer among the top technology trends but rather a thing of the past.</p><p>The next step after cloud computing is edge computing. It is another rising new technology in 2022 which is very similar to cloud computing, except that data is not stored in a centralised repository. In areas where network access might be difficult or impossible, cloud computing is challenging since you can no longer access the repository where your data is stored. What edge computing does is transfer data closer to the location where it needs to be used.</p><p>Edge computing has excellent applications in the Internet of Things devices. As far as IoT is concerned, a physical device you need to control with your smartphone should not need to access data from a centralised repository that might be thousands of kilometres away. Instead, data should stay as close to the device as possible.</p><p>Edge computing allows the data to remain at the ‘edge’ of the cloud and the device for processing so that commands can be followed through in a smaller amount of time.</p><p>Edge computing jobs have only begun to grow with IoT devices’ proliferation over the past few years. As the number of these devices increases, edge computing roles are likely to become more prevalent and lucrative, placing it firmly among the trending technologies in 2021-22.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</strong><br>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality have both been technology buzzwords for over a decade now. However, these latest technology trends in computer science have so far failed to materialise into widely available consumer products. The presence of virtual reality and augmented reality in our real lives is minimal. Eventhough VR and AR have been familiar in the industry, they are relatively new technologies in 2022.</p><p>Virtual reality has been used widely in video games thus far and augmented reality-based apps did become popular for a while a few years ago, before waning. However, the best way virtual reality can become a top technology trend for the future is by making it a part of people’s daily lives.</p><p>Over the past few years, virtual reality has also begun to find applications in training programs. Another domain where virtual reality experiences have been useful is in providing experiences to museum-goers. The trajectory of the rise of virtual reality is very similar to that of 3D technology—it might take just one application, such as cinema in 3D, for the technology to become mainstream. According to Payscale, average salary of AR Engineer is above 6 lakhs per annum, one more reason to give this new technology a try in 2022.</p><p>Virtual reality jobs do not currently require a lot of training. Simple programming skills should be enough to land you a job, alongside an interest in the field and the power of visualisation. With millions of virtual reality devices being sold worldwide every year, it is only a matter of time before we see VR and AR take over our daily lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Blockchain</strong><br>You have probably heard of Blockchain in the past few years, mostly in the context of cryptocurrency. However, Blockchain has grown to have several different applications. The significant part about Blockchain is that it is never under the complete control of a single entity due to being entirely consensus-driven. It can never change the data you store in the Blockchain used widely in sharing medical data in the healthcare industry.</p><p>Due to the security that Blockchain provides, this data can be shared among parties pretty much seamlessly. Another application of Blockchain is in maintaining the integrity of payment systems. Blockchain-based payment systems are currently highly immune to external attacks and theft. Blockchain can also be used in tracking the status of products in a supply chain in real-time.</p><p>The number of blockchain jobs has unexpectedly increased in the past few years and continues to increase. However, the number of applicants for such positions has also been growing in tandem. To bag a job in the blockchain domain, you need experience in multiple programming languages and in-depth knowledge of data structure and algorithms, OOPS, relational database management systems, and app development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8. 5G</strong><br>If there is one technology, the knowledge of which is still little, it is 5G. It is a new technology in 2022 for which companies and governments around the world have spent years preparing for the rollout of 5G technology. In several countries, this technology has already been rolled out and achieved a significant amount of success. Since 5G is currently in a nascent stage, it is available only to a limited extent and is also relatively expensive.</p><p>The number of compatible devices with 5G is also not appreciable, although most new mobile devices being released have 5G compatibility. 5G has a much greater capacity than the current 4G technology, with an average network speed of 100 Mbps and a peak speed of 20 Gbps. If you have multiple mobile devices in your home, 5G will probably connect to these devices and use them concurrently significantly easier.</p><p>When 5G technology was only in the development stage, 5G jobs were few, and most such jobs were allocated to employees within companies. However, companies have begun to hire network engineers over the past few months, specifically for jobs associated with their 5G networks.</p><p>As 5G technology has become more prevalent, there has been a scramble among networks to purchase spectrum and roll out the technology first. This has led to the requirement of a larger workforce focussed on the development and release of 5G networks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9. Cyber Security</strong><br>The number of devices and coverage about digital technologies has been rising, hence the threat by cyber-attacks on such devices. Cyber attacks can take many forms, from phishing to identity theft, and the need to guard the greater user coverage of the internet is greater than ever.</p><p>Simple antivirus software is no longer sufficient if you want to save yourself from cyber attacks. The development of better, more sophisticated technologies to guard against cyber threats is the subject of multiple academia and industry projects worldwide.</p><p>Companies are involved not just in making new commercial technologies to protect individual domestic consumers against cyber attacks. Some of the most frequent cyber-attacks are government data repositories or the storage facilities of large companies. Nearly all large companies need a way to protect their data and their employees’ data and associated firms.</p><p>Jobs in cybersecurity have been growing at thrice the pace as other tech jobs, primarily due to the reasons mentioned above. Not only are these jobs incredibly well-paying, but they are also some of the most critical positions in any firm. The 5G market in India is estimated to reach INR 19 Billion by 2025 so this new technology in 2022 can be a game-changer.</p><p>Especially in domains such as e-commerce and retail, the importance of cybersecurity cannot be underscored. Thousands of customers store their personal and financial data on retail companies’ websites to allow for easy payments. They also have accounts and passwords, which need to be protected. Similarly, in the healthcare industry, patient data needs to be protected against cyber threats.</p>', '2022-07-31 14:07:48', NULL);

APPLE IPHONE SE 2022 (THIRD-GENERATION)</h2><h3>THE BEST IPHONE UNDER $500</h3><p>The 128GB iPhone SE is the best value on the smartphone market, period. It’s a great deal at $479 when you consider that it will continue receiving iOS updates for upwards of five, even six or seven years.</p><p>But before you pick up an SE expecting to coast through most of the next decade without buying a new phone: make sure you can live with its very small, very dated 4.7-inch screen. It’s the same size as the one on the iPhone 6, and it’s starting to feel cramped in an age when apps and web pages are designed for bigger screens. The SE’s big bezels make the device look dated, too, but the usability of a small screen will be a bigger factor over the years to come.</p><p><i><strong>THERE’S NO NIGHT MODE FOR BRIGHTER PHOTOS IN VERY LOW LIGHT, WHICH IS A CURIOUS OMISSION</strong></i></p><p>That’s the biggest knock against the SE. Otherwise, it’s a fantastic midrange device. Its A15 processor is the same as Apple’s top-tier iPhone 13 Pro Max, so performance is excellent. There’s IP67 waterproofing and wireless charging — both uncommon in this price range — and even though it uses the same 12-megapixel camera that iPhones have used since the dawn of time, it takes very nice photos and high-quality video clips. The camera has no night mode, which is a curious omission — many other midrange phones offer some sort of low-light photo mode, and the phone’s processor is certainly up to the task. Apple gonna Apple.</p><p>This generation SE offers 5G connectivity — just low- and mid-band, which is fine. You won’t get the fast millimeter-wave 5G you might encounter in an NFL stadium, but it’s nothing to lose sleep over. Battery life is also improved over the last generation, and it will generally last a full day unless you really push it with demanding tasks like gaming and streaming video.</p><p>If you can live with the small screen and you aren’t bothered by the lack of night mode, we recommend picking up the 128GB version. The base model’s 64GB of storage isn’t quite enough, and you’ll be glad you spent the extra $50 when you’re using this phone for years into the future.</p><p><picture><source srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYbBmx4SdLFSPY1_PENDgofigTk=/0x0:2040x1360/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bfcEIFn7J6Sjgl33_CkoVPBXm9g=/0x0:2040x1360/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_U98rYTYiLP2e6K8HF-prBL4OSQ=/0x0:2040x1360/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UjOU_iUCVmKbIxa6p060tnxr3Ak=/0x0:2040x1360/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxrtTOMt9ih3OLBUBl6JQ-3OqNo=/0x0:2040x1360/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TGqujjj_8D1fiHp_g8JpeENU89M=/0x0:2040x1360/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vivLh2EVzi-YWey1swp0nV6Ed2Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-IoVQmFtJpwO_UmurwFBJA8n84=/0x0:2040x1360/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n8fijBxBtvyIaLR3xOxn487SELs=/0x0:2040x1360/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"90vw\"><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3loTEkG_zqEZuTDYJi7XtydjPzg=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqxLx3kTY9k_015STDKaJE1bfoo=/0x0:2040x1360/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BtlpVtfrzCgshWMkSjCLmkOmHGs=/0x0:2040x1360/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoPPDFWOIAENk5ZbA9QXs9MYt_Q=/0x0:2040x1360/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sjYkqiG_JL7-DGGa8Xg-3XUD9uE=/0x0:2040x1360/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JfFDTOmFEsa0mm8E1ginh4ihvfI=/0x0:2040x1360/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JCaE_He-6zB20zx5w8hqsBN6P_I=/0x0:2040x1360/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2gi9jeKUagJeJ2b6IhqIRWPvW4=/0x0:2040x1360/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z8yuuUX14Ux5UAYt0YlrPa5z6JE=/0x0:2040x1360/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y--0S0jZWjFOOjUESYdQ64A3J1g=/0x0:2040x1360/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371623/ajohnson_220405_5129_0005.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><i>The Samsung Galaxy A53 5G provides some uncommon budget-class features like waterproofing and a stabilized main camera.</i>Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge</p><h2>2. SAMSUNG GALAXY A53 5G</h2><h3>THE BEST ANDROID PHONE UNDER $500</h3><p>The Samsung A53 5G offers an outstanding value for its $449 MSRP. It has one of the best screens in its class — no surprise from display maker Samsung — with a 6.5-inch 1080p OLED that provides richer contrast than the LCDs that are common in this category. It also uses a top refresh rate of 120Hz, which makes for smooth scrolling and a little bit more of a “premium” experience.</p><p>The A53 5G’s battery lasts a full day of use, and the Exynos processor gets through daily tasks fairly smoothly. The phone’s main 64-megapixel camera is a cut above the usually unremarkable cameras in this class, with optical image stabilization to help get more sharp shots in poor lighting conditions.</p><p><i><strong>THE A53 5G’S BEST FEATURE MIGHT JUST BE ITS EXCELLENT SOFTWARE SUPPORT POLICY</strong></i></p><p>It stands out from other budget Android phones in a lot of ways, but the A53 5G’s best feature may be its excellent software support policy. Samsung has promised four years of Android OS version updates and five years of security updates. That gives the A53 5G an exceptionally long shelf life, especially among Android phones where two or three years of security updates is more common. Considering that the phone is also IP67-rated for dust and water resistance, it should last a long time.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Google will be launching its Pixel 6A in late July, which is really the only device on the horizon that could give the A53 a run for its money. On paper, at least, it compares well — with a five-year security support policy to match Samsung (though only three years of OS upgrades are promised). But the A53 sets a high bar, and right now, it’s easily the best Android phone in the class.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><picture><source srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9EWnSJu8gJ2BbqOmXbE5tTRCNJk=/0x0:2040x1360/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lK-ewk2IvXbZF-LFioR4v7EBxeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vOocJNstsKQFYrIsQm_7_KRoymI=/0x0:2040x1360/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCmgtK1k4iqZNHa2gPFBSNpEUTw=/0x0:2040x1360/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wJLLJ4jME7jokrdNsYxRP_krLIc=/0x0:2040x1360/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wb6q9yw9R8n5_Kq81muurNpkVhw=/0x0:2040x1360/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxyzhpZvxgRSo7c9rBMaoX2W1Dg=/0x0:2040x1360/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QdabT4mX_9vB-gSDeF3Kak4pJQw=/0x0:2040x1360/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GI80gvqM8ut4Yjb-fafz6aiX0Aw=/0x0:2040x1360/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"90vw\"><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MkYMvqSTt4FaWZIVHPhGClQ7W-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dcHPCNzfYPealwY_I5WmjpGSNWo=/0x0:2040x1360/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qpGvFXElw6Ef0mAZh8xw4SRlrJA=/0x0:2040x1360/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V6-CjAygpatbj-9MGUEPgW6ddlc=/0x0:2040x1360/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GHMMiWioPmE9W_ZZIxuFqlD09Oc=/0x0:2040x1360/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVwGd241-xUGwjqshmD3FK6bljk=/0x0:2040x1360/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KsZ1cwdlN9oq5ZvUv9pgQLT_k8s=/0x0:2040x1360/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kaCDHQ_wit-F86iT8_GfgvCKl8=/0x0:2040x1360/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GA8dKzk2-5KAjFw9OygKbYFWZYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6uMQSG6vPMdqYLq-BUkd80Jz1hE=/0x0:2040x1360/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418319/ajohnson_220425_5165_0004.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><i>The OnePlus N20 5G includes a 1080p OLED screen, with richer contrast than the LCDs common in this class.</i>Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge</p><h2>3. ONEPLUS NORD N20 5G</h2><h3>THE BEST PHONE UNDER $300</h3><p>The OnePlus N20 5G is a $280 phone that feels like it should cost a lot more. It offers a 6.4-inch screen with good 1080p resolution. Better yet, it’s an OLED panel in a category where lower-contrast LCDs are much more common. You’ll have to make do with a standard 60Hz refresh rate, but unless you’re coming from a phone with a faster 90Hz or 120Hz screen, you won’t know the difference. Refresh rate aside, it’s a good screen that’s enjoyable to use. Plus, there’s a good fingerprint scanner under the display that makes unlocking the phone a frustration-free experience.</p><p>The N20 5G is sold unlocked but take note: it does not work on Verizon. It’s also limited to 4G on AT&amp;T, which isn’t the end of the world given the carrier’s slow expansion of their mid-band 5G network (that’s the good 5G). The unlocked N20 does work on T-Mobile’s 5G as well as 4G, and you can buy a network-locked version of the phone directly from T-Mobile if you want to take advantage of a free phone offer or bundle the cost with your monthly phone bill.</p><p>The N20 5G is equipped with a good Snapdragon 695 processor and generous 6GB of RAM for very good daily performance. It also supports 33W wired fast charging — another feature you’d be hard-pressed to find in any of the N20’s competitors — with the included charger. You can charge the phone from 0 to 30 percent in just 20 minutes, which is really helpful if you’re in a jam and need a quick battery boost. NFC is also included for contactless payment; many cheaper phones exclude it to cut costs.</p><p><i><strong>THE N20 5G ALSO SUPPORTS 33W WIRED FAST CHARGING — ANOTHER FEATURE YOU’D BE HARD-PRESSED TO FIND IN ANY OF THE ITS COMPETITORS</strong></i></p><p>Camera quality is a bit of a weak point for the N20. The main rear 64-megapixel camera is fine; the other two cameras (a low-res macro and a monochrome sensor) are best ignored. The phone also ships with Android 11, which is a version behind most other new Android phones at this point. But on the brighter side, OnePlus is promising three years of security updates — a pretty good policy in a class where two years isn’t uncommon.</p><p>It’s unfortunate that the N20 isn’t an option for Verizon subscribers, but if you’re on T-Mobile or AT&amp;T, it’s a heck of a deal — with or without 5G support.</p><p><a

SAMSUNG GALAXY A13 5G</h2><h3>THE BEST BASIC ANDROID PHONE FOR VERIZON CUSTOMERS</h3><p>The Galaxy A13 5G is a no-frills, $249 phone that delivers the basics. Its screen is nothing special, but battery life and performance are very good considering the price, and the device is backed up by a solid support policy promising three years of security updates. It’s not as polished as the N20 with its fancier OLED, but it’s also a bit cheaper and works on all major carriers (the N20 doesn’t work on Verizon).</p><p>The A13’s 6.5-inch screen is certainly big, but it’s a fairly dim, low-contrast LCD with a resolution of just 720p. Related: battery life is very good since the screen drains less power than brighter displays. Overall performance from the MediaTek 700 5G chipset and 4GB of RAM is very good, too.</p><p><i><strong>THE SCREEN ON THE GALAXY A13 5G IS NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT BATTERY LIFE AND PERFORMANCE ARE VERY GOOD CONSIDERING THE PRICE</strong></i></p><p>On the camera side, the A13 lacks a couple of features you can find on other budget phones — namely, a night mode and an ultrawide camera. What you do get is a good 50-megapixel main rear camera that takes reliably good photos in daylight and dim indoor light. Just don’t expect much in very low light.</p><p>Overall, Samsung made some smart sacrifices in making the A13. If you can live with a mediocre display and a basic camera, then the A13 will deliver on performance and battery life — pretty important stuff. Just make sure you budget a little extra for a MicroSD card because the phone’s 64GB of built-in storage is a little skimpy.</p><p><a

MOTOROLA MOTO G STYLUS (2022)</h2><h3>THE BEST BUDGET PHONE WITH A STYLUS</h3><p>This year’s 4G-only edition of the Moto G Stylus continues to offer the excellent balance of features and cost-saving measures as last year’s model. It’s a good phone for the price, whether you’re a stylus devotee or just want a big cheap phone, and it works on all three major US networks.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus has a big 6.8-inch 1080p LCD display, good battery life with its 5,000mAh cell, and ample internal storage with 128GB of capacity. With a capable MediaTek Helio G88 processor and a healthy 6GB of RAM, the G Stylus performs well with everyday tasks. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine. The G Stylus is missing an NFC chip for contactless payment, and it doesn’t have wireless charging or an IP rating for water resistance, which are all common omissions at this price.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus’ stylus lives in the device, like the one on the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps, like its coloring book app. It’s a feature set intended for a more casual user than the likes of the S22 Ultra and, as a result, feels more approachable.</p><p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?xcust=___vg__p_21184237__t_w__r_google.com__d_D&amp;id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-g-stylus-gen-3/p?skuId=723&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aFS7beG0cfwz9svfm_qcukNVhxE=/0x0:1000x1000/300x300/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 300w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaDcfod7sRBqvJZvKbvLVFsW7lc=/0x0:1000x1000/400x400/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 400w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzFx8P9Rd6f99Kp6CNNJWsCVu_Q=/0x0:1000x1000/500x500/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 500w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZz2tnOjqoSYI_ND5NgSg8QLgf8=/0x0:1000x1000/600x600/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 600w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRWdYkJgJSByj2Gi7XZ5aRbCsPY=/0x0:1000x1000/700x700/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 700w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GBBfJ_EkifQxq3PfXPBsY8C1jds=/0x0:1000x1000/800x800/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 800w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3Bgp3uXMobq0of6cBhQ4i1XDcc=/0x0:1000x1000/900x900/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 900w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abKgU6zeXoTNt_a11CQ9SMi3qII=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8xcMxdcW0RGCn9dH8KjqCaBnnpE=/0x0:1000x1000/1100x1100/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1100w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5eCruTIk9Th-x4FxZ5CR_5d1Plk=/0x0:1000x1000/1200x1200/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtbtULTtV-9OH6Eg55fRh4QCDgg=/0x0:1000x1000/1300x1300/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1300w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YIAXwptx2iIxwR4XBbT-9se5FWY=/0x0:1000x1000/1400x1400/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1400w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v7EDgBDao0kZZ5oUmmzOZrnTPPM=/0x0:1000x1000/1500x1500/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1500w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klAJ7mLx0iXiMA33BYf5tqZxbDk=/0x0:1000x1000/1600x1600/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fdh-9-j3ApeD5LPNvKzuUwYEYpE=/0x0:1000x1000/1700x1700/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1700w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCBmkltllQx9XD2fCIpH7BUlI0I=/0x0:1000x1000/1800x1800/filters:focal(500x500:501x501):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390220/ajohnson_220411_5138_0001_squ.jpg 1800w\" type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1100px) 318px, (min-width: 880px) calc(((100vw -
